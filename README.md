# Literature on Circuits and Databases

This is a collection of papers at the intersection of circuits and databases.
To contribute, add an entry in [cdb.bib](cdb.bib) 
 (make sure to copy directly from [DBLP](https://dblp.org) when possible!), 
 and follow the syntax in [cdb.md](cdb.md) to add a citation.
Then open a pull request and GitHub will build the output html.
If you want to compile on your machine, install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and run `make`.
